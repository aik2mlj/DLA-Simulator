either on **every collision (DLCA)** or **with a certain probability (RLCA)**. 

considering repulsive and non-interacting particles, there is a  universal limit of the porosity of the structures which is given by the  aggregation of non-interacting particles. The characteristic parameter, to which this limit applies, is the  **fractal (Hausdorff) dimension**. Its value indicates **how effectively the  structure in question fills the available space**.

fractal dimension of **rotating aggregates** is **lower** than the one obtained within the standard DLCA. 

这个干了什么： 

- demonstrate that the structures found in experiments supporting the predictions of classical DLCA can be interpreted as a result of **rDLCA with residual interparticle repulsion**. 
- the variation of the **temperature** affects the structure of the aggregates only if they are formed by **repulsive particles**. In this case, corresponding to the RLCA, the **decrease of the temperature** **reduces** the likelihood that two repulsive particles approach each other close enough to form a bond and hence the **fractal dimension of the  aggregating clusters increases**.

The particles were confined to a cubic box with the edge *L* = 60. The number of particles *N* varied between 640 and 2800, yielding a set of volume fractions $φ_i$ = {0.0015514, 0.00193925, 0.00232711, 0.00290888, 0.00387851, 0.00484814, 0.00581776, 0.00678739}.

### Fractal dimension

we fitted the data in the size range 5 < *n* < 600, which  ensures that an increase of the fractal dimension of the aggregates due  to their overlaps through periodic boundary conditions is not taken into account.

#### 结论

无作用粒子：$f_d$与 初始粒子体积占比 和 温度 均无关

同样，吸引粒子与无作用粒子几乎完全一致

排斥力粒子的$f_d$更大
